This is not true stainless. Downgrading from 4 to 2 stars.Original:There is a trend for these small saucepans for heavier build. And i understand that this provide more even heating. However, my mother needed something more lightweight due to arthritis. These saucepans fit that perfectly in that they thick enough to be durable, but thin enough to remain lightweight. The only issue i see is that the lip is a bit too sharp. Most pots pans tend to have the edge nicely rounded and this you can feel like harsh corners of the edges. Other than that it's great."}, {"title": "A little lightweight, but good utility pots", "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "body": "Got these for my mother who (bless her heart) has been using the same beat up saucepans with cheap nylon handles that she got as hand-me-downs from her G-G-G-G-G-G-G-Great grandma who I think got them from the lost colonists of Roanoke island who decided they'd rather run off than burn something with them again. Anyway... some thoughts:What we like:- Excellent heat transfer: She has coil burners, and there's typically a 'cool' spot in the middle of pan where the burner coils don't reach. These distribute well enough that we don't see that spot.- Long handles. Good for deep stoves and inserting into the oven.- Easy to clean. So far, even with minor scratches, the metal remains durable and with natural non-stick common to good quality stainless steelWhat we find lacking:- A little light: For mom they are good, she's a bit older. But for me, for the price point they seem a little on the thinner metal side, a little too lightweight.- Lid handles are obnoxious. They stick up so high as to limit stackability and tucking into the proofing drawer, and don't even try to hang them on the inside of lower cupboard doors.Overall, excellent to cook with, she likes them, and now she's insisting I get married and give her 11 generations of babies, grandbabies and such, so the family can use these until the year 2525.

The quality is outstanding, they heat up quickly, the vented lid's top handle is designed for a 'cool to the touch' grab, the long-ish handles stay cool, the rims are flanged for no-drip pouring, and they're sturdy stainless steel. I have other saucepans, but they all have non-stick finishes, and I prefer the clean, 'no chemicals' approach these days. I've been using these almost daily for 2 weeks, for everything from oatmeal to soups, pasta, and sauces and gravies. They might require a little more work than non-stick cookware when it comes time for cleanup, but the steel is of such good quality, that they've been cleaning up like brand new every time. I use Barkeeper's friend on my Instant Pot liner to keep it looking new, and the same goes for these. I did a variety of cheese and cream sauces in these for Thanksgiving, and they didn't require steel wool soap pads for cleaning. I've been the chef of the house for 40+ years, and I have Calphalon, Tramontina, Swiss Diamond, All-Clad, et al, and the quality of these is on an even par, if not better than some. I'm loving using these, because they're sized right for small dishes, and they also don't take up a lot of room on my 5-burner cooktop. I'm really pleased with the performance and quality of these."}, {"title": "Great value", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "body": "Easy to clean it wipes out food easily.
